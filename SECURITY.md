# Security Policy

## Scope

This repository is maintained by [TypeFox](https://www.typefox.io) as open source software.

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and aim to handle reports in a responsible and coordinated manner.

This policy applies to vulnerabilities in the source code and published artifacts of this repository.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are generally provided for the latest released version.

Older versions may receive fixes at our discretion, depending on severity and feasibility.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability, please report it **privately** using GitHub’s vulnerability reporting feature:

🛡️ **Security → Report a vulnerability**

This creates a confidential security advisory visible only to maintainers.

**Please do not open public issues, discussions, or pull requests for security vulnerabilities.**

When submitting a report, please include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Affected version(s)
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact
- Any relevant logs or proof-of-concept code (if available)

Providing detailed information helps us triage and resolve the issue more efficiently.

## Handling and Disclosure

After receiving a report:

- We will assess whether the issue qualifies as a security vulnerability.
- We may request additional information if needed.
- If confirmed, we will prepare a fix or mitigation where feasible.
- We aim to coordinate disclosure responsibly and avoid unnecessary exposure before a fix is available.

Security fixes are documented in release notes. Where appropriate, a security advisory will be published through GitHub.

## Secure Development Practices

This project follows general secure development practices, including:

- Code review for all changes
- Controlled release processes
- Responsible dependency management

Where applicable, we align with recommendations from the [Eclipse Security Handbook](https://eclipse-csi.github.io/security-handbook/).
