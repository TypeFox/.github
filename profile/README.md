ðŸ‘‹ Hi, we are TypeFox â€“ a small team of software engineers with our headquarters in Kiel, northern Germany. We innovate and build open source tools, libraries and frameworks and help our customers to make optimal use of these open source components.

These are the main open source projects that we have founded and are actively maintaining:

 - [Langium](https://github.com/langium/langium) â€“ toolkit for domain-specific languages (DSLs)
 - [Theia](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia) â€“ web-based IDE framework similar to VS Code
 - [Sprotty](https://github.com/eclipse-sprotty/sprotty) â€“ diagram rendering library for visualization of models and data

You'll find more projects here on our GitHub organization.
